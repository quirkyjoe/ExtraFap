# ExtraFap

Primary Goals:
- Lightweight for low-cost hosting
- Easy tagging (suggest single tag for each image, hotkeys for yes/no)
- Load exclusively from source, no storage of content
- Hotkey support
- Custom feeds entirely based on tag/like analysis

Secondary Goals:
- Image pre-load for convenient browsing
- Autodetect dead image links?

Resources:
- For a previous effort (AIFap), a list of ~1500 subreddits to scrape roughly categorized by art-type, orientation, and tags: [GoogleSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G--uYCNwe_kTJhwXetRLPyUQSYySi-3Qtz2KXv2m-no/edit?usp=sharing)
